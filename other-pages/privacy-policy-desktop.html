            Like most website operators, The Arcterio collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. Arcterio's purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how
            Arcterio's visitors use its website. From time to time, Arcterio may
            release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
            e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

            Arcterio also collects potentially personally-identifying
            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
            users and for users leaving comments on https://arcterio.org.za blog
            posts. Arcterio discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses
            under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses

          Certain visitors to Arcterio's websites choose to interact with

          that Arcterio gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
