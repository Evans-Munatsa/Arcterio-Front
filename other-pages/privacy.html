                      the date and time of each visitor request. Arcterio's
                      purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
                      information is to better understand how
                      Arcterio's visitors use its website. From time to time,

                    Certain visitors to Arcterio's websites choose to interact
                    with Arcterio in ways that require Arcterio to gather
                    personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
                    information that Arcterio gathers depends on the nature of
                    the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
                    for a newsletter at https://arcterio.org.za to provide a
                    username and email address.
