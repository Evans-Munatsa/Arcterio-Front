                Like most website operators, The Arcterio collects
                non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
                and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
                language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
                visitor request. Arcterio's purpose in collecting non-personally
                identifying information is to better understand how
                Arcterio's visitors use its website. From time to time, Arcterio may
                release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
                e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

                Arcterio also collects potentially personally-identifying

                users and for users leaving comments on https://arcterio.org.za blog
                posts. Arcterio discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses
                under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
                personally-identifying information as described below.
